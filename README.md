Our team will be developing a secure web app to store customer current account and savings account info

bank = Bank()
bank.create_account("123", person1, "Savings", "Will Brigham", "secure_password")

Will update for commands to run from terminal...
Functionality will allow new customers to create accounts with a minimum balance of $500.
Customers are able to withdraw and and deposit money, and there are overdraft/withdrawal limits to protect customers
